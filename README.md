# password-generator

##
My objective for this assignment was to create a randon password generator. I accomplised this by executing the following steps:

* Creating seperate arrays for each character type the user may want included in their password and an empty array.
* Setting up a function as a framework for the random password generator.
    * Nested functions within the framework that prompts users to enter a password character length and what types of characters they want included.
    * If the user wants a specific character type in their password, the function is set to true and the contents of the array are pushed into the empty array.
* Once the user has inputted their password length and has chosen what character types they want included, the random number generator pulls the new array that was pushed into and randomly generates a password based on that array.
* Finally, the randomly generated password is displayed to the user.
